* I am pursuing Bachelor’s Degree in Information and Communication Technology in [School of Engineering and Applied Science, Ahmedabad, India](https://ahduni.edu.in/seas/).

* At present, I am a research & development intern at [ezdi India](https://www.ezdi.com/) in the field of machine learning. I am also part of undergraduate research group of a college in the area of deep learning.

* I am a Computer Science enthusiast and during my undergraduate studies so far, I have worked on several programming, research and design thinking based projects.I also have experience of Competitive Programming. I also have got a little bit flavour of electrical, communication and embedded systems.

* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning, as well as applied the concepts to solve real world problems related to data science and machine learning.
